# Genomic Data Science Specialisation

Please find Genomic Data Science Specialisation Programme Week 10 Capstone Project R Markdown file in this repo.

You will be able to reproduce the results if you follow the instructions in the ![R markdown](jhu_gdsc.Rmd) file. There's also an ![html file](jhu_gdsc.html) of the Rmd, if you are not sure how to open Rmd file.

For alignment, quality control and feature counts, you can download ![Galaxy workflow file](workflow.ga) and upload it to [Galaxy Main](https://usegalaxy.org). You can also find the FeatureCounts for the samples I used in the ![FeatureCounts](/FeatureCounts) folder, but I strongly recommend you to re-run the entire analysis yourself from scratch.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you need help!
